#*ngFor in Angular2

This repo contains a small snippet that compares **ng-repeat** of **Angular 1.x** with **\*ngFor** of **Angular 2**.

Well, to start of with - **ng-repeat** directive will NOT be available in **Angular 2**. It has been replaced by a new directive i.e. **\*ngFor**.

> Here is a recap:

* **ng-repeat** directive instantiated template once per item for a collection.
* Each template instance had its own scope.
* Special properties were available for each template instance : **$index**, **$first**, **$middle**, **$last**, **$even**, **$odd**.
* **ng-repeat** by default did not allow duplicate elements. A tracking function was responsible for this task.
* In order to add duplicate items, **track by** expression was used.
* Here is a small snippet:

```JavaScript
$scope.items = ['eat','sleep','work','eat']
```

```HTML
<div ng-repeat="item in items track by $index">{{$index+1}} : {{item}}</div>
```

* Object properties could also be iterated over. Here is a snippet for that:

```JavaScript
$scope.personDetails = {name:'Namita',age:'25'}
```

```HTML
<div ng-repeat="(key, value) in personDetails">{{key}} : {{value}}</div>
```

Now, let's move to main agenda of this discussion i.e. **\*ngFor**. Let's start.

* The major difference between **ng-repeat** and **\*ngFor** is its syntax. Here is a small snipped

```HTML
<ul>
    <li *ngFor="#item of items">{{item}}</li>
</ul
```

* **\*ngFor** is based on **JavaScript's** `for of` loop hence it can be used to iterate over **Arrays**, **Map**, **Set**. However it cannot be used to iterate over object properties straightaway.
>One of the possible work around could be extracting the keys from an object and then iterating it over the keys or use Map instead of object.

* Also other important difference is use of `#refs`. `#refs` would be widely used in **Angular2**. In this case `#item` contain the value of each item. `#refs` hold the reference of the element in cases such as:

> `ng-repeat` created inherited child scope for each element of collection, while `*ngFor` creates local variable in the that block.

```HTML
<input type="text" #inputText>
```

For the above case:

`inputText` would contain the reference of the element i.e. `<input type="text">`. `inputText.value` would contain the actual value entered in the input box.

* You would also be wondering what is the asterisk (\*) sign for. Asterisk (\*) sign is nothing but a syntactic sugar.

* Like **ng-repeat**, each instance element receives properties like **odd**, **even** , **last**, **index**. I have used these properties in the small example below:

import {Component} from 'angular2/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'my-app',
    template: `
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <h2>Enter To Do Items Below:</h2>
    <input (keyup.enter)="onKey(todo)" #todo>
    <div *ngIf="toDoList.length>0">
        <p>Your To Do Items:</p>
    </div>
    <div style="padding: 10px 0 0 0">
    <table width="300" border="1" cellpadding="5" style="text-align: center">
        <tr>
            <th>Index</th>
            <th>To Do Item</th>
        </tr>
        <tr *ngFor="#toDo of toDoList, #i=index, #last=last, #odd=odd, #even=even"  [ngClass]="{'odd-color':odd, 'even-color':even, 'last-color' : last }">
            <td>{{i}}</td>
            <td>{{toDo}}</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </div>
    `
})

export class AppComponent {
    toDo = {
        item: ''
    };
    title = 'My To Do List';
    toDoList = [];

    onKey(todo) {
        this.toDoList.push(todo.value);
        todo.value = '';
    }
}
```

>Note: It is not advisable to create grid structure using table tags but to keep the things simple I have used it here.

* As demonstrated above we have used index property to get the index of each item in the collection and assigned it to local variable `#i`. Similarly we have used other properties and assigned them to local variables in order to apply the classes conditionally on the table rows.

For example: `odd-color` class is applied on the row when item is odd. `odd` property returns a `true` or `false` on the basis of item index which is then assigned to local variable `#odd`.
    
* **Angular2** allows duplicate values in **\*ngFor** so we don't need **trackBy** any more and for unique value we use **Set**.

In order to run the demo given in this repo, clone this repository. Go inside the repo and write `npm install`. This would bring required node modules for you.

Now, run open **index.html** in your favourite browser!
